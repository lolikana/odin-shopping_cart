## Shopping Cart

The Shopping Cart is a web application developed using React and Vite. It allows users to browse and add products to their shopping cart. The app includes two main pages: the homepage and the shop page, which contains the shopping cart. The navigation bar is available on both routes, allowing users to easily navigate between pages. The project focuses on setting up the shopping cart functionality, while the homepage serves as a routing practice using react-router-dom.
